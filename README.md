In this project I will:

1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which I could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diï¬€erent variables. 

2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. 

3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. 

4. Detail my research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook
