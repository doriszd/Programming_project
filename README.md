### Author: Doris Zdravovic

In this project I will:

1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which I could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diï¬€erent variables. 

2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. 

3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. 

4. Detail my research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook

### About Numpy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a linear algebra library in Python. It is a very important library on which almost every data science or machine learning Python packages such as SciPy (Scientific Python), Matplotlib (plotting library), Scikit-learn, etc depends on to a reasonable extent. NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python.
